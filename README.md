# voxel mesher
## the cli
usage: `voxel-mesher [input] [output]`
this program takes in a file that has the following format
```
[x] [y] [z] [hex]
```
where x, y, z: i32s
and runs a greedy mesher on them then spits out a binary file

## the library
the library provides the api for the greedy mesher and basically everything
you could ever need. it also has decoding and encoding, in case it's needed.

use `VoxelMesh::decode` to decode a file generated by `VoxelMesh::encode`
note that `VoxelMesh::encode` takes in a `VoxelMesh` which consists of `Voxel` and an RGBA `u32`
it does not take in the file format accepted by the cli application. the cli application
simply converts that file format to a `VoxelMesh` and it is not included in the library
